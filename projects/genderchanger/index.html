            <h2>introduction</h2>
            <p>being transgender isn't something i talk about much, but i do feel my legal and social transition "speedrun" could
                be a good guide for anyone new to the administrative nightmare that transitioning in the United Kingdom is
                <br><br>
                i'll start off with some good news - right now we are *very lucky* compared to some other western countries.
                changing your name requires absolutely no interaction with courts or the legal system, and the same goes for
                changing your gender on the most important documents. i'm here to make sure you get it right first time
            </p>

            <h2>your legal name</h2>
            <div class="flex content">
                <p>thanks to some ancient nonsense laws, we have something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deed_poll">deed poll</a>
                    which allows you to change your name without any bullshit
                    <br><br>
                    there are TWO KINDS of deed polls, but you will use the "unenrolled" type.
                    <br><br>
                    the biggest difference between the two is that an "unenrolled"
                    deed poll does not require you to submit and publish your old and new name in <a href="https://www.thegazette.co.uk/">The Gazzette</a>,
                    and it can be done right now, for free.
                    <br><br>
                    some organisations may demand an "enrolled" deed poll, but your unenrolled one will have just as much
                    legal power
                </p>

            <h2>your driving license</h2>
            <p>the United Kingdom has no mandatory national photo ID, meaning you can live your entire life without any kind of ID. this
                also means that you might not have a document to identify yourself and prove your new name, so we're going to get you a
                <a href="https://apply-provisional-driving-licence.service.gov.uk/">provisional driving license.</a>
