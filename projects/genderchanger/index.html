            <h2>introduction</h2>
            <br>
            <p>being transgender isn't something i talk about much, but i do feel my legal and social transition "speedrun" could
                be a good guide for anyone new to the administrative nightmare that transitioning in the United Kingdom is
                <br><br>
                i'll start off with some good news - right now we are <b>very lucky</b> compared to some other western countries.
                changing your name requires absolutely no interaction with courts or the legal system, and the same goes for
                changing your gender on your most important documents.
                <br><br>
                i'm here to make sure you get it right first time &lt;3
            </p>

            <h2>your legal name</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                thanks to some ancient nonsense laws, we have something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deed_poll">deed poll</a>
                which allows you to change your name without any bullshit
            </p>
            <div class="flex content">
                <p>
                    there are <b>two kinds</b> of deed polls, but you will use the "unenrolled" type.
                    <br><br>
                    the biggest difference between the two is that an "unenrolled" deed poll does not require you to submit and
                    publish your old and new name in <a href="https://www.thegazette.co.uk/">The Gazzette</a>, and it can be done
                    right now, for free.
                    <br><br>
                    some organisations may demand an "enrolled" deed poll, but your unenrolled one will have just as much legal power.
                    they can fuck off
                    <br><br>
                    you'll need two friends, a pen, and some paper, so pop round to the bar for lunch one day and make a lil event of this!
                    signing documents doesn't have to be boring
                </p>
                <img class="half" alt="maeve, peeking over the top of her deed poll" src="https://img.birb.cc/RlYSqoj4.jpg">
            </div>
            <p>
                a deed poll can be literally anything, even scribbled on a napkin from a bar, as long as it has the right content!
                i used (and recommend) <a href="https://freedeedpoll.org.uk/">this deed poll generator</a>
                <br><br>
                ensure you...
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>select <b>Normal Deed Poll</b></li>
                <li>include your <b>old title</b> in the "Old Name" box</li>
                <li>include your <b>new title</b> in the "New Name" box</li>
                <li>select <b>First name changed?</b></li>
                <li>are choosing a name that <a href="https://freedeedpoll.org.uk/restrictions">meets the restrictions</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                your two witnesses can be anybody who knows you, but they <b>cannot be family members</b> or <b>someone you're dating.</b>
                friends, your teachers, any colleagues or even your boss is fine!
                <br><br>
                print off 5 or so copies of this deed poll, preferably on some thick cardstock instead of plain printer paper.
                you're not really supposed to have multiple deed polls, but this will really help if your original is lost in post, damaged,
                or you need to send it off to multiple places at the same time.
                <br><br>
                once your deed poll is signed by you and the two witnesses, you are now legally <b>[INSERT NEW NAME HERE]</b>
                <br><br>
                congratulations ^w^

            <h2>your driving license</h2>
            <br>
            <p>the United Kingdom has no mandatory national photo ID, meaning you can live your entire life without any kind of formal documentation.
                this also means that you might not have a document to identify yourself and prove your new name, so we're going to get you a
                <a href="https://apply-provisional-driving-licence.service.gov.uk/">provisional driving license.</a>
            </p>
            <h3>even if you will never drive a car, you should get a provisional license.</h3>
            <p>
                <b>if you already have a provisional or full driving license, you'll need:</b>

                In addition to updating my name I also request to update the details regarding my gender (such as the code in the driving licence number) from male to female.

                Kind regards,

            <h2>certified copies</h2>
            <br>
            <p>some places (usually banks) won't accept just a deed poll, and also ask for a copy of your driving license or passport.
                unfortunately you can't just use any photocopy, it needs to be a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/certifying-a-document">certified copy</a>
                <br><br>
                only someone of good standing or a professional can certify that a photocopy of a document is legitimate.
                once you have your driving license, it's very useful to get a copy of it certified
                <br><br>
                take a look at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/certifying-a-document">this gov.uk website</a> for more information
            </p>

            <h2>banks</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                most banks will ask for a certified copy of your ID in addition to a deed poll. each bank has different policies, and sometimes will
                ask you to come in to a branch physically to update your documents. if they refuse to change your title, stand firm and escalate your
                request to a branch manager, then regional manager.
                <br><br>
                you'll need to look up the specific policy for your bank - don't forget about savings accounts and other investments!
            </p>

            <h2>HMRC</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                you'll need to update your name with HMRC and your employer's payroll. If you're removing your middle name, you'll need to call HMRC
                instead of using the website. You can see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tell-hmrc-change-of-details">HMRC's guidance here</a>
                <br><br>
                HMRC require you to have a GRC for them to update your gender. if they ask if you're updating your legal gender as well as name,
                say yes and give it a chance!
