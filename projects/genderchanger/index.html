            <h2>introduction</h2>
            <p>being transgender isn't something i talk about much, but i do feel my legal and social transition "speedrun" could
                be a good guide for anyone new to the administrative nightmare that transitioning in the United Kingdom is
                <br><br>
                i'll start off with some good news - right now we are <b>very lucky</b> compared to some other western countries.
                changing your name requires absolutely no interaction with courts or the legal system, and the same goes for
                changing your gender on your most important documents.
                <br><br>
                i'm here to make sure you get it right first time &lt;3
            </p>

            <h2>your legal name</h2>
            <p>
                thanks to some ancient nonsense laws, we have something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deed_poll">deed poll</a>
                which allows you to change your name without any bullshit
            </p>
            <div class="flex content">
                <p>
                    there are <b>two kinds</b> of deed polls, but you will use the "unenrolled" type.
                    <br><br>
                    the biggest difference between the two is that an "unenrolled" deed poll does not require you to submit and
                    publish your old and new name in <a href="https://www.thegazette.co.uk/">The Gazzette</a>, and it can be done
                    right now, for free.
                    <br><br>
                    some organisations may demand an "enrolled" deed poll, but your unenrolled one will have just as much legal power
                    <br><br>
                    you'll need two friends, a pen, and some paper, so pop round to the bar for lunch one day and make a lil event of this!
                    signing documents doesn't have to be boring
                </p>
                <img class="half" alt="maeve, peeking over the top of her deed poll" src="https://img.birb.cc/RlYSqoj4.jpg">
            </div>
            <p>
                a deed poll can be literally anything, even scribbled on a napkin from a bar, as long as it has the right content!
                i used (and recommend) <a href="https://freedeedpoll.org.uk/">this deed poll generator</a>
                <br><br>
                ensure you...
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>select <b>Normal Deed Poll</b></li>
                <li>include your <b>old and new title</b> in the "name" boxes</li>
                <li>select <b>First name changed?</b></li>
                <li>are choosing a name that <a href="https://freedeedpoll.org.uk/restrictions">meets the restrictions</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                your two witnesses can be anybody who knows you, but they <b>cannot be family members or someone you're dating.</b>
                friends, your teacher, any colleagues or even your boss is fine!
                <br><br>
                print off 5 or so copies of this deed poll, preferably on some thick cardstock instead of plain printer paper.
                you're not really supposed to have multiple deed polls, but this will really help if your original is lost in post, damaged,
                or you need to send it off to multiple places at the same time.
            </p>

            <h2>your driving license</h2>
            <p>the United Kingdom has no mandatory national photo ID, meaning you can live your entire life without any kind of formal documentation.
                this also means that you might not have a document to identify yourself and prove your new name, so we're going to get you a
                <a href="https://apply-provisional-driving-licence.service.gov.uk/">provisional driving license.</a>
            </p>
            <h3>even if you will never drive a car, you should get a provisional license.</h3>
            <p>
                <b>I already have a provisional driving license, or a full UK driving license:</b>
                <br><br>
